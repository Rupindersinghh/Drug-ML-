Project Overview – Lab 2: Classification Model Comparison
This repository contains the work for my Lab 2 assignment in Machine Learning, where I applied and compared three popular classification algorithms on the Drug200 dataset. The objective was to predict the type of drug prescribed to a patient based on attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and Na-to-K ratio.

Models Used
Logistic Regression

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Decision Tree Classifier

Each model was trained, tested, and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. I also handled data preprocessing (e.g., label encoding and train-test splitting) and visualized the results with tables, bar plots, and a correlation heatmap.

What’s Included
A Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step code and markdown explanations

Comparison of model performance

Visualizations to support the findings

Final report (APA-formatted) with references

drug200.csv dataset

This project helped me gain practical experience with model evaluation and interpreting results in a real-world healthcare context.
